## JavaScript

JavaScript is a **loosely typed** and **dynamic** language

- loosely typed we don't have to know the type of data we are gonna use to declare a variable

- dynamic meaning you can change the type after the variable has been declared

`let cat;`

`cat = 3;`

`cat = 'squeeeee';`

## Data Types

- `'hello'`, `'feownf32432590ew-rfeaf'`

### Numbers

### Boolean

- Logical data type
- `true` `false`
