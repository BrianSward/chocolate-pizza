## Arrays

- Data Type/Data Structure **special type of object**
- A collection, list of elements
  - can be mixed - hold strings, numbers, booleans, other arrays
- In JS we don't have determine the size of our array
- Every element in the array will have a position - index - way we can locate elements in the array
  - Zero based index (very first element lives at index 0)

- Arrays built in methods
  - `.push()` - adds to the end of an array
  - `.pop()` - remove the last element of the array

- Property
  - `.length` - tell me how many elements are in the array

## Loops

### For Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - Great for doing something a certain number of times
  - Great for iterating or looping through arrays!

```javascript
for(starting value; condition; increment){
  do something for a finite number of times
}
```

### While Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - While loops do something until the condition is false
  - Beware of infinite loops!

```javascript
while(condition){
  runs this code until the condition is false
}
```
